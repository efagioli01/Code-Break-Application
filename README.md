  ## Description / Objective
  Our team created the Code&lt;br> application to demonstrate our ability to design, build and deploy a responsive full-stack web application to Heroku. The application was created with React (JavaScript Library for building user interfaces) and the MVC paradigm. It includes GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server. A MongoDB with the Mongoose ODM was implemented for the database. Queries and mutations for created for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data. Json Web Tokens (JWT) were used for authentication. The team collaborated via Zoom and Slack, and used Git branching workflow and Agile software development methodology.

  ## Business Need
  Code&lt;br> addresses the developerâ€™s need to share, store, find reusable code snippets to reduce development time.

  ## Key Features 
  The key features of this application include:

  * A responsive site with a visually appealing user interface
  * A landing page with a view of recent code snippets
  * A filter to enable users to view snippets by primary language (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.)
  * A secure and user-friendly login and signup functionality
  * A user dashboard that enables users to view, update or delete thier code snippets
  * A privacy setting to allow users to make thier code snippets public or private
  * Comment functionality to enable users to share thier thoughts on fellow web developers' snippets
  * Like and Dislike functionality to help grade snippet quality and usefulness

  ## Tools
  The tools used to build the Code&lt;br> application include: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express.js, Highlight.js, GraphQL, MongoDB and Mongoose, Robo 3T, Bcrypt, Json Web Tokens (JWT), Dotenv, Heroku, Github, Git Bash, Visual Studio Code, Slack and Zoom.

  ## Use
  To run this application locally: clone it to your desktop, run npm install and npm run develop.

  ## Future Considerations
  Given the limited time we had to create this project, we created a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The following enhancements are considerations for future development:

  - Enable sharing of snippets via email and text
  - Display hightest rated or most favorited code snippets first on the homepage
  - Expand filter options (highest rated, by subject)
  - Enable user to 'favorite' other users' code snippets
  - Enable versioning so users can improve existing code snippets
